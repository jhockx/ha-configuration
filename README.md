# Home Assistant configuration
This repository is part of my [Home Assistant Github project](https://github.com/users/jhockx/projects/1), which contains all the software and hardware repositories which I have setup so far for Home Assistant. You can consider this repository the "main repo" of the project, where you will find the configuration of my Home Assistant in separate Markdown files and corresponding links to other repositories. Check out the following subjects:
- [Gas Water Light monitoring](https://github.com/jhockx/home-assistant-configuration/blob/master/GWL%20monitoring.md):  
Configuration to readout electricity/gas data from the Dutch Smart Meter (DSMR) and SMA solar inverter. Furthermore, all these sensors are combined for a proper setup. Lastly, I am sending my gas data to [mindergas.nl](https://mindergas.nl/) via REST calls.
- [Data storage](https://github.com/jhockx/home-assistant-configuration/blob/master/Data%20storage.md):  
Overview of my current architecture and the configuration for each component.

### Hardware
Currently I'm using a Raspberry Pi 3B with an A2 rated 64GB SD card.
